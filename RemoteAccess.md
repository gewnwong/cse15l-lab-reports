## Installing VScode

To download VScode, I started by going to [Visual Studio Code's Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

I clicked on the button labeled "Download Mac Universal" and, after the zip file had finished downloading, I found it in my finder and unzipped it.

I was then able to open and run the application.

(Note: My display doens't look exactly as VScode upon first opening because I'd downloaded it prior to this lab)


## Remotely Connecting

To start conencting to the remote serve, since I was using Mac OS, I opened the terminal on my computer located in Launchpad.

After my terminal was up, I then typed in the command ```ssh cs15lwi23auq@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` to access my student remote server. A message prompting for my password showed up, I entered it, and agreed to connect to the host (only necessary for first connection to the remote server).

Another message then showed up indicating I was currently logged into the remote server.

## Trying Some Commands 

I tried a variety of commands on the remote server, thus going in and out of directories (`cd`)(`..`), printing the contents of files (`cat`), and viewing the current working directories (`ls <directory>`).

 I also performed similar commands on my computer after using the exit command so I could better understand the progression within my terminal from my finder.

I thought it was interesting to be able to go through the finder I've always been using in a different format. This lab was also the one of the first times I opened the Terminal app on my computer to actively do something; previously, I hadn't really acknowledged that it held a function.

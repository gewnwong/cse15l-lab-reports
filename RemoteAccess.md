## Installing VScode

To download VScode, I started by going to [Visual Studio Code's Download Page](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Remotely Connecting

To start conencting to the remote serve, since I was using Mac OS, I opened the terminal on my computer located in Launchpad.

After my terminal was up, I then typed in the command ```ssh cs15lwi23auq@ieng6.ucsd.edu``` to access my student remote server. A message prompting for my password showed up, I entered it, and agreed to connect to the host (only necessary for first connection to the remote server).

Another message then showed up indicating I was currently logged into the remote server.

- I tried a variety of commands on the remote server, thus going in and out of directories (cd)(..), printing the contents of files (cat), and viewing the current working directories (ls <directory>. 
- I performed similar commands on my computer after using the exit command since I could check the progression within my terminal from my finder.

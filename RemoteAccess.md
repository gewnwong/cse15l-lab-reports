- I didn't have to download VScode in this session because I had already downloaded it onto my device for CSE11.

## Remotely Connecting

- To connect remotely, since I was using Mac OS, I opened the terminal on my computer and directly typed in the command ```ssh cs15lwi23auq@ieng6.ucsd.edu```.
- After entering my password and agreeing to connect to the host, my terminal displayed a message indicating I was currently logged in.

## Trying Some Commands

- I tried a variety of commands on the remote server, thus going in and out of directories (cd)(..), printing the contents of files (cat), and viewing the current working directories (ls <directory>. 
- I performed similar commands on my computer after using the exit command since I could check the progression within my terminal from my finder.
